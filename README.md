# Protein-sequence-alignment
To generate identified peptides alignment maps across protein sequence and individual samples

Input files: 
1. FASTA file: protein sequence in fasta format containing the same entries as used in database search was required as sequence database to be mapped on
2. Search result: in excel format containing identified peptide sequence in individual sample and related protein IDs from database was used to locate the peptides in the protein sequences.
